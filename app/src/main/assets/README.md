# Assets Directory

This directory is for application assets that need to be bundled with the app.

You can place any files here that your application needs at runtime, such as:
- Configuration files
- Custom fonts
- Sample data
- Calibration files
- Additional resources

Files in this directory can be accessed at runtime using the AssetManager.
